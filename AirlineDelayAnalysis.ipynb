    "The dataset we will analyze here, consists of information about domestic flights operated by large airlines in the U.S. throughout 2008. It provides details about the schedule and delays of each flight. The data was originally  compiled and made available to the public by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, but the version we will use here was obtained from Kaggle, at: \n",

Information about delays (deviations from the scheduled timeline) is particularly intersting, as it provides us with the opportunity to analyze how delays are related to other factors and how much are domestic flights affected. The results will hopefully provide insights useful to passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of the information at hand, we could consider digging for answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the major causes of delays and cancellations affecting domestic flights in the U.S.?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which are the best and the worst carriers (airlines) regarding delays and cancellations? Which are the carriers with the less/most cancellations and the shortest/longest delays?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we identify periods of the year 2008 when delays were particularly long? For instance, days of the week or months of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there any combinations of variables that appear to determine the expected delay time or probability of cancellation of a flight?\n",

    "- Could we estimate the probability of a flight being cancelled based on some of the variables?\n",
